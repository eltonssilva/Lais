## Introduction

### What is Iro?

Iro (named after the Japanese word for "color") is a small JavaScript color library for use in web projects. The main feature is the color picker UI, but it comes with some additional utilities that are useful for when dealing with colors.

The goal is not to be a direct one-to-one replacement for established libraries like [Spectrum](https://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/) or [jscolor](http://jscolor.com/) - which already serve their purpose well - rather, Iro is intended to be more suitable option for certain use-cases. For example, iro would be great in an interface where a user can customize the color of something such as a profile page or a product order, however it wouldn't suit an application that requires precise accuracy and obscurer color models.

### Core Features

* Pretty color wheel UI with touch support
* Color model conversion between RGB, HSV, HSL and hex RGB
* Dynamically update CSS styles as the selected color changes
* Zero dependencies (not even jQuery or extra stylesheets/images)
* HiDPI / retina screen support
* Supports all major browsers from IE10 up
* Lightweight, at just under 11KB minified (or ~4KB minified + gzipped)
* Can be used standalone or bundled with AMD / CommonJS / etc
* Buzzword buzzword buzzword, you get the idea

      <br/>
      <strong>NO account linking required.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <ul> 
      <li>Add this node to your flow</li>

    <p/>

    <h3>Known issue:</h3>
    <ul> 
      <li>Doesn't support Echo Gen 2 & Echo Plus local devices discovery yet</li>
      <li>Echo Show, Echo Spot, Sonos One do not have the capability to discovery devices locally</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload
            <span class="property-type">string | on/off</span>
        </dt>
        <dd> "on" or "off" trigger from Alexa.
             <br/>
             when dimming command is issued, this payload stays "on" as long as <strong><i>bri</i></strong> > 0. In other words, payload == "off" only when <strong><i>bri</i></strong> == 0.
        </dd>
        <dt>bri <span class="property-type">int | 0-100</span></dt>
        <dd> support for dimming commands
             <br/>value ranges from 0 to 100 (percent). Use this property to get the variable level from dimming command such as "Alexa, dim the light to 49%".
             <br/>
             When dimming command is not used, this parameter will be 0 for "off" and 100 for "on" command.
        </dd>
        <dt>bri_normalized<span class="property-type">float | 0.0-1.0</span></dt>
        <dd> support for dimming commands
             <br/>value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. Similar to above <strong><i>bri</i></strong> parameter, except this has been normalized to [0.0 - 1.0] range.
             <br/>
             When dimming command is not used, this parameter will be 0.0 for "off" and 1.0 for "on" command.
        </dd>
        <dt>change_direction<span class="property-type">int | -1/0/1</span></dt>
        <dd> support for decrease/increase command
             <br/>when decrease/increase command is issued, this parameter is set to -1/1 accordingly; normally it is 0.
        </dd>
        <dt>on_off_command<span class="property-type">boolean | true/false</span></dt>
        <dd> indicate whether the command was an on/off command or a dimming/brightness command
             <br/>eg. Alexa turn on/off light -> true
             <br/>    Alexa set light to 39% -> false
             <br/>    Alexa set light to 0% -> false
        </dd>
        <dt>others...</dt>
        <dd> attach a Debug node for complete msg object to see other parameters available</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Input (optional)</h3>
    
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload
            <span class="property-type">on/off/0-100</span>
        </dt>
        <dd> This is for updating the 'bri' value when there are external changes to the device via other inputs.
          <br/>If <strong>'Input Trigger'</strong> is enabled, this will also trigger this node. Accepted values are:
          <br/> • number: 0-100
          <br/> • "off": equivalent to input 0
          <br/> • "on": equivalent to input 100
          <br/> • "toggle": toggle between On and Off
          <br/> • "increase": increase bri by 25%
          <br/> • "brighter": increase bri by 25%
          <br/> • "decrease": decrease bri by 25%
          <br/> • "dimmer": decrease bri by 25%
          <br/> • "+N": increase bri by N% (string)
          <br/> • "-N": decrease bri by N% (string)
        </dd>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    
    <p>Each Node ID is used to uniquely identify & persist each device seen by Alexa. If you delete and re-create this Node, the device is no longer the same. You would have to forget old device in Alexa app. Changing of <strong>Name</strong> is supported, but you would need to ask Alexa to re-discover devices again.</p>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Does it support German or other languages?</strong>
      <br/>Yes! As long as Alexa supports that language.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Does it support door lock/curtain/AV/TV or other types of devices?</strong>
      <br/>Unfortunately no. In order to keep this node so simple to use, it was designed to emulate a Philips Hue bridge & device within local network. Amazon Echo is hardcoded to support only on/off/dimming command via this route. Any other type of support has to go through the Alexa Skills route (cloud-based). There is another node does just that <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/node-red-contrib-alexa-home-skill" target="_blank">node-red-contrib-alexa-home-skill</a>
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Example dimming commands</strong>
      <br/> • Alexa, set Kitchen Light to 40%
      <br/> • Alexa, set Aircon temperature to 30
      <br/> • Alexa, increase Kitchen Light
      <br/> • Alexa, lower Kitchen Light by 15%
    </p>

    <p><strong>Do I need to enable any Alexa Skils?</strong>
      <br/>No. Nah. Non. Nein. Never.
    </p>

    <p><strong>I have some suggestions, how do I contact you?</strong>
      <br/>Please create an issue in <a href="https://github.com/originallyus/node-red-contrib-alexa-local/issues" target="_blank">Github</a>
    </p>

    <p><strong>How do I control my (non-smart) devices at home with NodeRED?</strong>
      <br/>Check out <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.originally.tasker&hl=en" target="_blank">RMPlugin app</a> also developed by us. Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUKYKhK57sc" target="_blank">intro video</a> about the hardware.
